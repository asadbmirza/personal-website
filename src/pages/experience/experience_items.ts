        "During my internship on StackAdapt’s Measurements Team, I was able to contribute heavily to full-stack features on the company’s Programmatic Advertising Platform using React, React Query, MUI, Ruby on Rails, and GraphQL. I implemented various features such as fullstack deletion logic from the ground up for brand lift studies to resolve a long-standing user issue with reusable frontend components and custom hooks to improve UX with real-time feedback. I also refactored key UI tables to support upcoming ABM features, reducing future development time, and introduced quality-of-life improvements such as bug fixes, mock data support, and test coverage. Throughout, I collaborated cross-functionally with product managers, designers, and with other teams to clarify requirements and deliver features in an Agile environment.",

        "Reflecting on my time with Saige, I’m proud of the features I delivered and the full-stack skills I developed. I worked on a web app that helps uncover hidden real estate opportunities, using Python/Flask, React, and MySQL. I built a Google Maps-powered feature that adds nearby schools and shopping centers to each property page, and debugged complex search filtering issues to improve accuracy. I also deployed a property assessment script to an AWS EC2 instance, which continuously pushed data into our MySQL database. Working closely on the team with real product features taught me a lot about problem-solving, cloud computing, and writing secure, efficient code.",

        "I had been eyeing a TA position for a while, so I made a real effort over the summer to get involved by networking with faculty. I did research over the summer under Professors Irene Huang and Brian Harrington to deepen my understanding of CS education. That work paid off when I was selected by Professor Purva Gawde and Irene Huang from over 200 applicants to TA for CSCA08, a course with hundreds of first year students. In this role, I helped students grasp Python and core CS fundamentals during lecture, and quickly became a go-to resource during office hours for those looking for more personalized support. I also assisted in grading tests, reviewing student's code, and providing feedback to help them improve. I loved the experience of teaching and mentoring students, and it was rewarding to see them grow and succeed.",

        "I applied to Riipen and was thrilled to get in after just three months. Soon after, I started applying to opportunities through the platform and landed an interview/position with the startup company ServiceNext, which led to my first real-world development experience. Working with the ServiceNext team taught me a ton about frontend development and collaborating within a team. I gained hands-on experience using React to build web app components and picked up libraries like React Bootstrap and Formik, tools I built upon and even used in some projects. I also learned how to work with GitHub in a team setting, using branches and pull requests to keep our codebase clean and organized. Overall, this experience gave me practical skills and the confidence to contribute effectively in a professional development environment.",

        "My very first job, had a great time working with kids and teaching them how to swim. I was responsible for ensuring the safety of all swimmers, teaching lessons to swimmers/rookie lifeguards of all experiences, and providing first aid when necessary. I also had the opportunity to work with a fantastic group of people. The environment was super welcoming, fun, and brought me different experiences every day. This job taught me valuable skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. I also learned how to handle difficult situations calmly and effectively, which has helped me in my personal and professional life.",
